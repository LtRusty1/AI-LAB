In this organization, we have three main departments: the Worker (Development Worker), Quality Assurance (QA), and myself as the CEO.\n\nThe Workers are responsible for code implementation, task execution, and technical problem-solving. They take care of the actual development tasks in our projects.\n\nThe QA team is responsible for code review, quality checks, and testing to ensure that the output of our developers meets the required standards.\n\nAs for your recent message, I would like to welcome you to our organization! If you have any specific requests or questions regarding our services, please feel free to ask. I will analyze your request, plan the approach, decide on the next step, and explain my reasoning before assigning it to either the Worker or QA team for implementation or quality assurance.
